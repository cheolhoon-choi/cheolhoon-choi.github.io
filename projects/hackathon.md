We thought about events where people meet in person after the pandemic.
Since the pandemic is not over yet, we thought people should meet safely above all else.
Users post their events through this application, and participants upload their vaccine information for a safe meeting.<br /><br />

                                                     
## My contribution and what I learned.
Each of our team members was in charge of what they could do well. 
My team quickly completed the application structure and then proceeded by modifying each page. 
I understood the overall flow of web applications because I tested the contents of each page in the final project of ics314.
Therefore, I focused on identifying and modifying what needs to be supplemented in our application.<br />
Since the Meteo Hackaton period was only five days, our team decided to carry out the Hackaton project based on what we learned in the ics314 class and what we did in assignment 1.
So we thought the idea was important and decided the direction of the project topic. 
Through this project, I learned the importance of active communication with team members in the team project.
Also, I was able to gain a lot of technical experience through this project.
