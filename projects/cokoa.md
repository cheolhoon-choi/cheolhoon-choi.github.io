</p>
We wanted to create a user-friendly application and wanted it to show the health of the user at a glance. 
So, when the user logs in to COKOA, it shows the user's current health status for COVID-19.
Through the left menu, users can check up their health status every day and check and modify their profiles and vaccine records.
In addition, they can go to the web pages related to COVID-19 through the right menu.<br />

</p>
The project focused on checking daily health status and uploading users' vaccine cards. 
The user can check each symptom of COVID-19 and all of these records are stored. All stored symptoms can be confirmed. 
In addition, the user can check the accurate information by uploading the user's vaccine record card.<br />
<br />

Our team created a mobile version because we wanted this web application to be available anywhere. 
Users can show others whether they are vaccinated or not through this application.<br />

## What I learned
I was able to learn many things through this project. 
Creating a mobile version of a web application was another challenge for me.
I got a lot of help from the group members. Therefore, I was able to gain a lot of technical experience through this project.
