### Overview

Software Engineering II (ICS 414) was a project class that implements the functions requested by customers based on what we have learned so far. 
The team project was for the Homeless Outreach and Medical Education, which allowed me to learn about the potential real situation and the experience of solving real problems. 
Customers were looking for an application that could help manage inventory of their medications and supplies. 
Our team has created a user-friendly application Zeus that allows you to find all the core functions you want on one page. 
Zeus provides an easy-to-use interface to add new medications to the inventory, edit them in the current system, and delete medications if necessary. 
It also simplifies the distribution of medications to inventory by filling out a simple form by providers who dispense medications to patients. 
In summary, Zeus is an application that helps visualize medical inventory and track where it is stored.

The website itself has a simple login page that takes an email and password. Once signed up, an administrator can assign a role to the account. The provider role grants access to adding and editing inventory items while the student role only allows for dispensing items. Items are split into two pages, medications and supplies. To dispense an item you click on a small button at the top right. A modal will popup with required information to fill out. Once dispensed, the inventory gets updated and a log history is made. The ability to filter the items through a search bar and dropdown was also added to make looking for specific items easier.

### The importance of communication
Our team consists of eight members, and the work was divided into team members, and each person was responsible for completing it by the deadline. 
I think communication is one of the most important factors in carrying out the project. We communicated using Discord, but as time went by, we did not talk much. 
We only worked on the part we each chose, and the code became complicated due to lack of communication. 
We had a hard time interpreting spaghetti code, but the wonderful team members overcame the difficulties themselves. 
I think we would have developed more improved application if we had more active communication.

### What I learned
Through direct conversation with customers, we were able to accurately understand and grasp certain aspects of the program that customers wanted. 
Therefore, I think this class was a good experience to clearly recognize and practice what we have to do. 
It was a fantastic experience to demonstrate the ability to cooperate with team members and improve programming skills. 
It was a fantastic experience to show the ability to cooperate with team members and improve programming skills. 
I also learned the importance of active communication with team members in the team project. I was able to gain a lot of technical experience through this project.
