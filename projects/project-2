I majored in ICT at KCC and learned Java as my first subject. I never studied computer language, so I had no background in it. Thus, I was really confused about the first class in Java.

The first start was 'Hello World.' It was just a few lines of code anyone could do, but I was really happy to see what I wanted on the screen. Even now, when I learn a new language, I always try 'Hello World' first. This is my sacred ritual of encountering a new language.

I learned Java for a year and finally made Pokemon games as a group. The process was not easy because colleagues also learned Java for the first time.  However, in the end, we made the Pokemon game and it went well. I wanted to learn another language by studying Java. Also, I thought I should study Java again because I thought my code was too complicated. If I make the code more concise, it will be easier to understand each other when working with others.
