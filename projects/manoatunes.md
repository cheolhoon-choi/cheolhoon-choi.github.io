We wanted to create a user-friendly site. Entering the Manoa Tunes, you can find information about this site in key areas such as upcoming jam, today's track, important site features, and potential questions. Also, users can easily find other people with passion for music and make music bands easy.<br />

### What I learned
<img class="ui large floated rounded image" src="/images/M3.png">
I was able to learn many things through this final project. I learned a lot during the semester, but it was not easy to do a project based on what I learned. I even transferred from KCC this fall, and I have never seen group members because of the Covid 19 Pandemics. This made it harder to work in a group. However, my group members worked hard on their roles and helped each other with their difficulties. I also got a lot of help from the group members. Therefore, I was able to gain a lot of technical experience through this project. It was a good opportunity to learn how to proceed with a group project.
