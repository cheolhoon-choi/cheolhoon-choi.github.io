I wanted to study more during summer vacation. A friend who majored in computer science and is currently working in an IT company recommended Python. He said Python can study alone because it is an easy language. So I studied Python alone, and I made a rock-paper-scissors game with Python.

I learned Java for a year at KCC. The learning process was really hard, but I think it was possible to learn Python alone because I learned Java. So I thought if I knew one language properly, I could learn another language easily.
