Software engineering is an absolutely necessary concept. It will be used forever and in almost every other category. If the code itself is not systematic and overlaps, the software can be a very complex and tedious task. Software engineering makes the code more visible and implements the method behind it, making it clear and concise about the intended purpose and how it works. 

Drawing in my head what I have to do to achieve something helps me think about what is first and what should be prioritized. I like to use this method but I need more practice. Thinking code mentally and completing most of the code before actually writing it will certainly help me in the future. Software engineering will help the world I will meet in the future and will establish itself in this industry forever.
