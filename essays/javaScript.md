I am the first student to learn Javascript, but I can compare Java with Javascript because I learned Java at KCC.

JavaScript has many advantages compared to Java. JavaScript has no compilation process, so script code can be written in a short time. And unlike C language and Java, it has very simple structures and principles, so beginners can learn and understand easily. For example, it is not necessary to declare variables, classes, and methods within JavaScript codes, nor to distinguish whether the methods are 'public' or 'private' or 'protected'. Because JavaScript is a web-specific technology, it works well regardless of operating system or platform and has high scalability. Also, JavaScript does not require file or memory management because it runs in a specific environment, such as a web browser. However, JavaScript has disadvantages in terms of performance and security. The functions provided inside JavaScript are limited, and there are few related development tools. In addition, JavaScript is written with HTML source codes, and the source code is open to the outside, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.


I really think WOD is useful. I learned a lot from the PreCodeCamp curriculum. Unknown problems were solved through Google Search, but I often didn't fully understand them. Therefore, I wanted to understand things that I did not know correctly while solving various problems. Also, I wanted to solve more application problems because these curriculum problems had only basic problems. WOD practice questions can be done by listening to professors' lectures and through feedback with colleagues. So I can ask questions that I do not know, and I can also learn as I answer the other questions. Also, solving one problem every day has the advantage of being able to study steadily. There is some stress that I have to study every day, but I think WOD is really useful for my future.
