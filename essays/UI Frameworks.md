### UI Framework

This week I learned for the first time how to use the UI framework, Semantic UI. The biggest advantage of semantic UI is that customizing is formatted in general English. Therefore, I thought the UI framework could be started relatively easily. What I mean is to use the UI framework to get some results quickly. I have learned Java and C programming languages before, and it took me more than six months to code to actually do something useful. However, with UI frameworks, I was able to imitate the look of a website in a week. 

### My Challenges

Learning the UI framework was not smooth. Work was very stressful because I didn't know anything at first. Some of the troubles I had with UI frameworks were getting images, word sorting, and implementing grids. Text and images did not appear as I expected, and the colors I wanted did not appear on the screen either. The website I first created looked like junk. However, as I learned and practiced, I got better pretty quickly. I felt comfortable enough to feel ready to take the WOD, but in the end, I did not finish the WOD. The only thing I could not do was get rid of the white space on the edge of my website.

### My thoughts on UI framework

In general, I think the benefits of software engineers using UI frameworks are the creativity and use that the tools of the framework give. I always wondered how the website was actually built up. By learning about the UI framework, I could see how it was made and how it worked. I think it is amazing that the ability of the UI framework and the creativity of the designer could be together.
