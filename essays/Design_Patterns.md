Patterns are everywhere. We can see patterns that share the consistency of shapes, colors, and numbers. Also, each of us lives in a specific pattern and this pattern will be able to predict future situations. There are countless examples of patterns used informally in everyday life. It can be said that the design pattern of programming is the most appropriate pattern for this class.

### Characteristics and Advantages of Programming Design Patterns

Design pattern refers to solutions that can be solved in the context of a particular part of the software design or program development process by organizing frequently occurring problems. Programming design patterns are helpful for communication. Designers who know design patterns can use patterns that have something in common to a particular problem to discuss solutions, enabling better communication. Proven intellectual patterns are economical because they can create high-quality designs in a short period of time and provide an environment where code levels can be raised and desired goals can be achieved at a small number of tiers.
<br />
A good design or architecture is named Pattern, so developers can know the structure of the software just by the pattern name. Based on this, the design or structure used to develop existing software can be easily understood and quickly applied to new software, making software reuse easy.

### Considerations when using software design patterns

I think it is important not to memorize design patterns, but to apply them directly to the code to determine which patterns will be applied to various situations in the future and to develop the ability to apply them. Design patterns are also becoming more diverse, and they are often used by modifying existing design patterns. Therefor, you must learn various design patterns and apply them to your own code, and deep study and many worries are also essential.
